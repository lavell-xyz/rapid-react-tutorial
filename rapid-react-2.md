## Getting Started

Make sure you've completed <a href="https://link.lavell.xyz/rapid-react-1" target="_blank">Step 1</a>, which will explain how the development environments work, and help you brush up on Javascript / web technologies.

Open up the development environment for this step in a new tab/window, so you 
can follow along in the code. Just reading isn't enough! You must _practice!_

## Components

When designing a program, it is helpful to break it down into modular units that fit
together to make a greater whole. This is true not just in UIs, but across the 
range of types of things a program might try to model. React's focus on components makes this concept easy to put into practice. 

To define a React Component, you need:

* A set of parameters that get passed to the component, called **props**
* A **render** method which tells React how to draw the component

That's it!
