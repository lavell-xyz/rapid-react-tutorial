## Introduction

This tutorial aims to provide a solid introduction to app prototpying
and development, with as few pre-requisites as possible. 

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you
 compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called 
 **components**. 
 
 React is designed around rapid iteration, where
 changes you make to the code are quickly refreshed and displayed back
 to you. This will enable you to build out your ideas
 more quickly and reliably, then having to constantly wait around long
 build times with opaque tools (especially when working on UI, which
 is inherently visual).

 ## Pre-Requisites

Having a working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS will definitely help
you get going on this tutorial. 

Most essential perhaps, is just a basic 
working knowledge of how programs operate - i.e. what is a function,
what is a variable, etc. 

You will be guided step-by-step in this tutorial, with plenty of 
checkpoints and guides. So even with a bare minimum of pre-existing
knowledge, you should be able to jumble your way through. 

## Development Tool

To get you up and running with minimal fuss, this tutorial will use an
online coding environment, [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com), which lets you write and run
your code in real-time on your web browser. That also makes this tutorial
cross-platform - try it on Linux, macOS or even Windows.

 On the left, you have the 
project files. In the middle, the code editing pane. And on the right,
the live-reloading result of your React endeavors.

## Checkpoints

Each step will contain links to multiple "Checkpoints", which are 
self-contained development environments that allow you to edit and 
run the code, right in your browser. Each checkpoint will contain the
code up to that point in the tutorial - so, if you're following along,
you can make sure your coding matches up to mine. Or, if you get lost,
just start from that most recent checkpoint, and you'll be fine!
