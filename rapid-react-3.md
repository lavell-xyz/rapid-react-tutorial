## How do I make it look nice?

So, you've got a _very_ basic setup on your hands, that has an internal
representation of the **Card** data structure, and a simple rendering
of the Cards as plaintext in a column. Cool, from a programmer's point
of  view - but not quite a working prototype! Time to remedy that.

## CSS

If you've done any amount of web development before, you've come across
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS is a language for defining the 
aesthetic of the visible aspects of a webpage - or in our case, a
web **app**.

If you have no experience at all in CSS, I recommend checking out
